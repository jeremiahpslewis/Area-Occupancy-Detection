# Area Occupancy Detection Documentation

Area Occupancy Detection aims to improve occupancy accuracy beyond single motion detectors by considering various environmental factors, device states, and historical data. It uses Bayesian probability to calculate the likelihood of an area being occupied based on multiple sensor inputs and learned patterns.

## Key Concepts

### Bayesian Probability

The integration uses Bayes' theorem to update occupancy probability based on sensor evidence:

1. **Prior Belief**: Baseline probability of occupancy (learned from history)
2. **Sensor Evidence**: Current state of configured sensors
3. **Likelihood**: How reliable each sensor is (learned from history)
4. **Posterior**: Updated probability after considering new evidence

### Sensor Types

The integration supports multiple sensor types with different default weights:

- **Motion Sensors** (1.00): Highest reliability, ground truth for occupancy detection
- **Sleep** (0.90): Very high reliability for overnight occupancy
- **Media Devices** (0.85): High reliability indicator of active use
- **Wasp in Box** (0.80): High reliability virtual sensor for single-entry rooms
- **Cover Sensors** (0.50): Moderate reliability for blinds, shades, shutters, garage doors
- **Appliances** (0.40): Moderate reliability
- **Door Sensors** (0.30): Lower reliability, but useful for entry/exit
- **Power Sensors** (0.30): Power consumption indicating active device usage
- **Window Sensors** (0.20): Minimal influence
- **Environmental Sensors** (0.10): Very low influence (temperature, humidity, illuminance, CO2, sound pressure, atmospheric pressure, air quality, VOC, PM2.5, PM10)

## Example Use Cases

### Living Room

- **Sensors**: Motion sensors, TV, door sensors
- **Patterns**: High occupancy in evenings, low during work hours
- **Automation**: Turn on lights when occupied, dim when low probability

### Office

- **Sensors**: Motion sensors, computer, door sensors
- **Patterns**: High occupancy during work hours, low on weekends
- **Automation**: Turn on/off lights based on occupancy, adjust HVAC

### Bathroom

- **Sensors**: Motion sensors, door sensors
- **Wasp in Box**: Maintain occupancy when door is closed
- **Automation**: Turn on lights when occupied, turn off when unoccupied

## Challenges with Basic Motion Sensors

- **Lights turning off while you're still:** If you sit still for too long, a basic motion sensor assumes the room is empty.
- **False triggers:** A pet walking through might trigger occupancy.
- **Limited context:** Simple motion doesn't know if you're watching TV, working at a desk, or just passing through.

## How Area Occupancy Detection Helps

This integration provides enhanced room occupancy detection for Home Assistant by intelligently combining data from multiple sensor inputs. Unlike simple motion sensors, it leverages Bayesian probability calculations to factor in various environmental cues and device states, leading to more accurate and resilient occupancy detection.

- **Increased Accuracy:** By fusing data from multiple sensor types (motion, doors, media, etc.), the system gains a much richer understanding of the area's status.
- **Probabilistic Approach:** Instead of a simple ON/OFF state, it calculates an _occupancy probability_. You decide how certain the system must be before declaring occupancy.
- **Adaptability:** The prior probability learning feature analyses how _your_ sensors correlate with actual occupancy, learning which sensors are reliable indicators.
- **Reduced False Negatives/Positives:** The combination of multi-sensor input, learned probabilities and decay logic significantly reduces incorrect occupancy states.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Sensor Fusion:** Combines inputs from motion/occupancy sensors, media players, doors, windows, covers, appliances, power sensors, sleep presence, and environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, illuminance, CO2, sound pressure, atmospheric pressure, air quality, VOC, PM2.5, PM10).
- **Bayesian Inference:** Calculates the probability of occupancy based on the current state of configured sensors and their individual learned likelihoods.
- **Prior Probability Learning:** Automatically learns how sensor states relate to actual occupancy (using motion sensors as ground truth) over a configurable history period.
- **Configurable Weights:** Assign weights to different sensor _types_ to influence their impact on the overall probability.
- **Probability Decay:** Gradually decreases the occupancy probability when sensors indicate inactivity, providing a natural transition to "unoccupied".
- **Purpose-Based Decay:** Choosing a room purpose automatically sets a decay half life suited to the space.
- **Configurable Threshold:** Define the probability percentage required to consider the area "occupied".
- **Exposed Entities:**
  - Occupancy Probability Sensor (%) - per area and aggregated "All Areas"
  - Occupancy Status Binary Sensor (on/off) - per area and aggregated "All Areas"
  - Presence Confidence Sensor (%) - per area and aggregated "All Areas"
  - Environmental Confidence Sensor (%) - per area and aggregated "All Areas"
  - Prior Probability Sensor (%) - per area and aggregated "All Areas"
  - Evidence Sensor - per area only
  - Decay Status Sensor (%) - per area and aggregated "All Areas"
  - Detected Activity Sensor (enum) - per area only
  - Activity Confidence Sensor (%) - per area only
  - Sleeping Binary Sensor (on/off) - per area only (when people configured)
  - Occupancy Threshold Number Input - per area only
- **All Areas Aggregation:** Automatically creates aggregated entities across all configured areas for whole-home occupancy detection.
- **UI Configuration:** Easy setup and management through the Home Assistant UI.
- **Manual Prior Update Service:** Trigger the prior learning process on demand.

## How It Works

1. **Configuration:** You select various sensors associated with an area (motion, doors, media players, etc.) and configure parameters like weights and the history period for learning.
2. **Prior Learning:** The integration analyses the history of your selected sensors against all configured motion sensors. It calculates:
   - **P(Sensor Active | Area Occupied):** How likely is a sensor to be active when the area is truly occupied?
   - **P(Sensor Active | Area Not Occupied):** How likely is a sensor to be active when the area is _not_ occupied?
   - **P(Area Occupied):** The baseline (prior) probability of the area being occupied, derived from motion sensor history.
     These learned probabilities (or defaults if history is insufficient) are stored and used in calculations.
3. **Real-time Calculation:** As your sensor states change, the integration uses Bayes' theorem. For each _active_ sensor, it updates the probability of occupancy based on its learned likelihoods and the overall prior probability.
4. **Weighted Combination:** The contributions from individual active sensors are combined in log space and weighted by sensor type.
5. **Output:** The final calculated probability is exposed. If it crosses the configured threshold, the Occupancy Status sensor turns "on".
6. **Decay:** If the probability starts decreasing (fewer active sensors), an exponential decay function gradually lowers the probability over a configured time window, unless new sensor activity pushes it back up.

## Common Issues

1. **No Occupancy Detection**:

   - Verify sensors are working correctly
   - Check threshold setting
   - Ensure sensors are properly configured
   - Adjust sensor weights

2. **False Positives**:

   - Lower weights for less reliable sensors
   - Increase occupancy threshold
   - Adjust decay settings
   - Review time-based priors

3. **False Negatives**:
   - Increase weights for reliable sensors
   - Lower occupancy threshold
   - Add additional sensors
   - Check time-based prior patterns
