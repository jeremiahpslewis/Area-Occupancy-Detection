# Sensor Health Monitoring

The integration continuously monitors the health of all configured sensors and alerts you through Home Assistant's **Repairs** system when issues are detected. This helps you identify degraded sensors that may be reducing occupancy detection accuracy.

## How It Works

During the hourly analysis cycle, the integration checks each sensor for:

- **Stuck active** — a binary sensor has been continuously active for longer than expected
- **Stuck inactive** — a binary sensor hasn't changed state for an unusually long time
- **Unavailable** — a sensor has been offline for more than 1 hour
- **Never triggered** — a sensor has never been active since it was added (checked after 7 days)

When an issue is detected, a repair entry appears in **Settings → System → Repairs** with a description of the problem and actionable troubleshooting steps. Repairs are automatically dismissed when the sensor recovers.

## Detection Thresholds

Thresholds are tuned per sensor type to avoid false positives:

### Stuck Active (sensor continuously "on")

| Sensor Type | Base Threshold | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Motion | 8 hours | mmWave/presence sensors can legitimately stay active for a whole evening |
| Media | 12 hours | TVs/speakers may run for hours but not overnight |
| Appliance | 24 hours | Ovens/washers can run for hours but not a full day |
| Door | 48 hours | Doors can legitimately stay open for a day or two |
| Window | 72 hours | Windows may stay open for days in warm weather |
| Cover | 24 hours | Covers shouldn't stay in transition for a full day |

The base threshold is multiplied by the area's [purpose](purpose.md), so rooms
where long stillness is normal get much more headroom:

| Area Purpose | Multiplier | Effective motion threshold |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Bedroom (`Sleeping`) | ×6 | 48 hours |
| Media Room (`Relaxing`) | ×4 | 32 hours |
| Office (`Working`) | ×3 | 24 hours |
| All other purposes | ×1 | 8 hours |

Two exemptions apply: `media_player.*` entities are never flagged for being
`unavailable` (a TV powering off is normal operation, not a fault), and the
virtual Sleep presence sensor is excluded from all health checks.

#### A stuck sensor stops counting

Once a sensor is flagged stuck active, it **no longer counts as evidence**.
Otherwise a TV left paused for a day would hold the room occupied with nobody
there. The sensor counts again the moment it changes state. When a stuck
stretch finally ends, it doesn't start a decay either, because it never
counted in the first place.

The repair stays open for you to fix. If the long activity is real (a TV
that genuinely plays all day), **Ignore** the repair and the sensor keeps
counting.

Stuck stretches don't train the model either. When the area learns from
history, any motion or media stretch longer than its stuck-active threshold
is cut to the threshold, so a sensor stuck on can't teach the room a habit.
Sleep sensors are never cut.

!!! tip "Turning it all off"
    Repair monitoring can be disabled entirely under **Configure → Global
    Settings → Enable sensor health monitoring**. Ignored repair issues also
    stay ignored across restarts and condition flaps.

### Stuck Inactive (sensor never changes state)

| Sensor Type | Threshold | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Motion | 7 days | A motion sensor should detect something within a week |
| Media | 14 days | Media devices should be used within two weeks |
| Appliance | 28 days | Some appliances are used infrequently |
| Door | 14 days | Doors should open/close within two weeks |
| Window | 14 days | Windows should be opened within two weeks |
| Cover | 14 days | Covers should be used within two weeks |
| Power | 14 days | Power sensors should show variation within two weeks |

### Other Checks

| Check | Threshold | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Unavailable | 1 hour | Sensor has been offline (dead battery, connectivity loss) |
| Never triggered | 7 days | Sensor has never been active since it was added to the integration |

### Away from home

A sensor that sits idle while everyone is away isn't stuck or misconfigured. While the household is away, the **stuck inactive** and **never triggered** checks pause, and any open alerts of those two kinds clear. When someone comes back, idleness counts from the return rather than from before the trip, so a holiday doesn't raise every alert the moment you walk in. **Stuck active** keeps being checked while you're away, since a sensor that's on in an empty house is more suspicious, not less.

There are two ways to tell the integration the household is away. It uses one at a time, never both.

**Person tracking** is the default. When Home Assistant's **Home** zone counts nobody home (`zone.home` is `0`), the household is away. This needs [person entities](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/person/) with device trackers, which is what drives `zone.home`. Without them, or while none of them has a known location, the checks behave as they always have.

**An away mode entity** replaces person tracking. Under **Configure → Global Settings → Away mode entity**, pick an `input_boolean`, `binary_sensor` or `switch` that is **on** while you are away, such as a vacation-mode toggle. While it is on the household is away, and while it is off the household is home. Once one is set, `zone.home` and the person entities are not consulted at all. That suits a home with no person entities, and one where phone locations say something other than the truth, such as a house-sitter staying while you are away. Clear the field to go back to person tracking.

The entity is read during the hourly health check, so a change is picked up at the next one, and the return is timed to that check. While the entity is `unavailable` or `unknown`, or no longer exists, the checks run as they always have. They do not fall back to person tracking, so what pauses them never depends on which of the two happens to be readable.

If your entity is on while someone is *home*, such as an "anyone home" sensor, put a template binary sensor in front of it that reverses it, and pick that one:

```yaml
template:
  - binary_sensor:
      - name: "Household away"
        state: "{{ is_state('binary_sensor.anyone_home', 'off') }}"
```

## Excluded Sensors

The following sensors are excluded from health checks:

- **Sleep sensors** — virtual sensors that are managed by the integration
- **Wasp in Box sensors** — virtual sensors for bathroom occupancy
- **Environmental sensors** (temperature, humidity, illuminance, etc.) — only checked for unavailability, not for "stuck" states, since their values change continuously

## Repair Issues

Repair entries appear in **Settings → System → Repairs** and include:

- The affected sensor's entity ID and area
- How long the issue has persisted
- The sensor type and applicable threshold
- Specific troubleshooting guidance

### Severity Levels

| Issue Type | Severity | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Stuck active | Error | Sensor is likely malfunctioning |
| Unavailable | Error | Sensor is offline — occupancy detection is degraded |
| Stuck inactive | Warning | Sensor may be dead or misconfigured |
| Never triggered | Warning | Sensor may be misconfigured or unnecessary |

### Auto-Resolution

Repair entries are **automatically deleted** when the issue resolves:

- A stuck sensor changes state → repair disappears
- An unavailable sensor comes back online → repair disappears
- A never-triggered sensor fires for the first time → repair disappears

You can also manually dismiss repairs in the HA UI if you've investigated and determined the issue is expected.

## Sensor Health Entity

Each area gets a diagnostic sensor entity that exposes health status:

**`sensor.<area_name>_sensor_health`**

- **State:** Number of current health issues (0 = all healthy)
- **Icon:** `mdi:heart-pulse` when healthy, `mdi:alert-circle` when issues exist
- **Entity Category:** Diagnostic

**Attributes:**

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `issues` | List of issue details (entity_id, type, duration, description) |
| `healthy_count` | Number of healthy sensors |
| `total_count` | Total number of sensors in the area |
| `last_check` | Timestamp of the last health check |

The Evidence sensor also includes a `health_status` field in its `details` attribute for each entity, showing one of: `healthy`, `stuck_active`, `stuck_inactive`, `unavailable`, `never_triggered`, or `excluded`.

## Pipeline Health

In addition to per-sensor checks, the same health monitor flags **calculation pipeline** issues per area — silent failures in the integration's own learning surface that would otherwise leave you wondering why occupancy looks wrong. These appear in **Settings → System → Repairs** alongside sensor issues, with their own translation key family (`pipeline_health_*`) so they're distinguishable.

| Issue | When it fires | Severity |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Insufficient priors** | Area has been running for more than 7 days but no global occupancy prior has been learned. The integration is silently falling back to a minimum baseline for every Bayesian update. | Warning |
| **Stale intervals cache** | The occupied-intervals cache (rebuilt hourly) is older than 25h, or has never been populated for an area more than 7 days old. Indicates the analysis pipeline has stopped refreshing for this area. | Error |
| **Slow analysis** | The most recent full analysis cycle took longer than 30 seconds. Usually points to database pressure, very large sensor / area count, or a long-running correlation run. | Warning |
| **Prior above threshold** | At some hour of the week, the area's learned prior reaches its occupancy threshold, so it reads occupied then with no sensor active. The prior is learned from your own history, so it may be right. The repair names the hour and suggests a threshold 5 points above the peak (or, for a peak above 94%, explains that no threshold leaves that headroom within the 99% limit on probability); ignore it if the behavior is what you want. | Warning |
| **Correlation failures** | Half or more of the area's correlatable sensors failed correlation analysis on the last cycle (e.g. `too_few_samples`, `no_occupied_intervals`). Without correlations, sensors can't be tuned to your installation's behavior. | Warning |

### How to read pipeline issues

Each repair entry includes a short numeric summary in the title (hours since the issue started, hours of cache age, etc.) and a longer description with **What to do** steps tailored to the failure.

- For the deepest detail, download diagnostics from the integration card — pipeline issues are surfaced under each area's `health` section, and the inputs that drove them (priors, cache age, correlation `analysis_error` fields) are visible in the same dump. See [Diagnostics](../technical/diagnostics.md).
- All of these issues auto-resolve when the next analysis cycle finds the underlying state has recovered (e.g. the prior is learned, the cache rebuilds, analysis completes faster, correlations succeed).

## Common Scenarios

### Dead Battery

A Zigbee motion sensor runs out of battery and goes `unavailable`. After 1 hour, a repair entry appears:

> **binary_sensor.bathroom_motion_1 is offline in Bathroom**
>
> The motion sensor has been unavailable for 5 hours. The integration is currently falling back to learned priors for this area.

### Stuck Sensor

A PIR sensor gets stuck in the "on" state (hardware malfunction). After the 8-hour base threshold (this area has no purpose multiplier):

> **binary_sensor.toilet_motion_1 appears stuck in Toilet**
>
> The motion sensor has been continuously active for 9 hours, which exceeds the 8-hour threshold.

### Misconfigured Sensor

A kitchen oven binary sensor is configured but the power threshold is too high, so it never triggers. After 7 days:

> **binary_sensor.kitchen_oven may be misconfigured in Kitchen**
>
> The appliance sensor has never been active in 7 days of monitoring.

## Tips

- Check the **Sensor Health** diagnostic entity in your dashboards to see at-a-glance health across areas
- Use the **Evidence** sensor's `details` attribute to see per-entity health status alongside probability contributions
- If a sensor is intentionally unused, consider removing it from the area configuration rather than ignoring the repair
- The health check runs hourly — new issues may take up to 1 hour to appear after a sensor degrades
